            <h2>DOSA</h2>
            <p>
                Dosa is a popular, thin, fermented rice and lentil pancake from South India,
                 known for its crispy texture and served with accompaniments like sambar 
                 (lentil-based vegetable stew) and chutney (savory paste). The batter,
                  made from ground rice and black gram (urad dal), is fermented to achieve a light, fluffy consistency.

            <h2>CHICKEN</h2>
            <p>
                The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue,
                 something that is particularly important as we age.
                  Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density.

            <h2>PANCAKES</h2>
            <p>
                Pancakes are flat, often round, cakes made from a batter that is cooked on a hot surface like a griddle or frying pan.
                 They are a diverse food with variations worldwide, from the thin, unleavened English style to the thick,
                  fluffy North American version made with a leavening agent like baking powder.
